        <p>I am married with a 2 year old daughter and another on the way. I feel blessed to have all that I have in life and that I have opportunities before me.</p>

        <p>My interest in writing code is not to start a new career or advance in a position as I am self employed and do very well. My desire to learn to code is rooted in the realization that all of the programs that exist in my industry are inadequate to work at my pace.</p>

        <p>I have many ideas that would make my work more efficient and productive. I firmly belive that I can turn 30 minute tasks into 3 minute tasks. This is powerful in my industry. The technology already exists, it just needs to be reconfigured and integrated.</p>

        <p>With my busy schedule and a growing family finding time is always a struggle. No matter what at the end of this course I will have learned enough to not only continue my journey but to realize my goal of creating software for my industry.</p>
